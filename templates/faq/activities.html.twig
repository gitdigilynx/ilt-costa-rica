        <div class="faq_question">What happens if activities are affected by weather conditions?</div>
        <div class="faq_answer">
            We understand that weather conditions can sometimes impact planned activities. Here's our policy 
            regarding weather-related situations:
            <br /><br />
            <span style="font-weight: 500">1. Activities Running Rain or Shine:</span> Many of our activities are designed to operate regardless of 
            weather conditions. Light rain or drizzle might not necessarily affect the activity, and it can even 
            add a unique element to the experience.
            <br /><br />
            <span style="font-weight: 500">2. Severe Weather:</span> In cases of severe weather conditions that could pose safety risks to 
            participants or compromise the quality of the activity, we prioritize safety above all else. If the 
            weather is deemed unsafe by our experienced guides or activity providers, we may decide to 
            postpone or reschedule the activity.
            <br /><br />
            <span style="font-weight: 500">3. Rescheduling:</span> If the weather forecast indicates better conditions at a later time or date, we'll 
            make every effort to reschedule the activity for your convenience. Your safety and enjoyment 
            are paramount.
            <br /><br />
            <span style="font-weight: 500">4. Refund Policy:</span> In cases where the activity cannot be rescheduled due to weather or other 
            unforeseen circumstances, we'll apply a refund for the affected portion of your booking. Our 
            goal is to ensure fairness and customer satisfaction.
            <br /><br />
            <span style="font-weight: 500">5. Open Communication:</span> We maintain open communication with our clients and closely monitor 
            weather conditions. If there are any concerns about weather affecting your scheduled activity, 
            our team will promptly reach out to discuss possible options.    
            <br /><br />
            Your safety and enjoyment are our top priorities. Rest assured that we'll do our best to provide you with 
            a memorable and enjoyable experience while considering safety and weather conditions. If you have 
            any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us.

        <div class="faq_question">Should we leave a tip with our guide?</div>
        <div class="faq_answer">
            Tipping is not mandatory, but it is highly appreciated. Generally, a tip of 20% to 25% is the norm. That 
            being said, the amount is at your discretion and may vary depending on your level of satisfaction and 
            the number of participants.
